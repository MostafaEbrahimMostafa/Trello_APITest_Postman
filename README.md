# 🚀 Trello API Test - Postman

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Trello API Test** project is designed to validate Trello's API functionalities using **Postman and Newman**. This project automates key API operations, including **board management, list management, and card handling**, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and robustness in API responses.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objectives of this testing framework are to:
- ✅ **Ensure API reliability and functional correctness** by validating CRUD operations.
- ✅ **Enhance test coverage** across different scenarios, including edge cases and negative testing.
- ✅ **Optimize testing efforts** by reducing manual intervention and executing automated API tests efficiently.
- ✅ **Improve reporting and debugging** through **Newman and HTML reports**, providing insightful execution logs and visualized test results.
- ✅ **Implement best practices** for maintainable and scalable API testing.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

| Technology/Tool         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Postman**            | API testing and request automation |
| **Newman**             | CLI-based execution of Postman collections |
| **JSON Assertions**    | Validates expected vs actual API responses |
| **Collection Runner**  | Batch execution of API test cases |

## 📂 Project Structure
The project follows a well-organized folder structure to ensure scalability and maintainability:
